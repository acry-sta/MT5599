 * = Delta/Notch simulations with cellular protrusions and Notch-dependent cell division =
 *
 * EMPTYLINE
 *
 * == Introduction ==
 *
 * EMPTYLINE
 *
 * In this tutorial we show how Chaste can be used to simulate a growing cell monolayer culture
 * into which a model of Delta/Notch/Reporter signalling with mutual inactivation is incorporated. 
 * This model was developed by Sprinzak et al. (Sprinzak D, Lakhanpal A, LeBon L, Garcia-Ojalvo J, Elowitz MB (2011) 
 * "Mutual Inactivation of Notch Receptors and Ligands Facilitates Developmental Patterning". 
 * PLoS Comput Biol 7(6): e1002069. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002069) 
 * This comprises three ODEs to describe the evolution in concentrations of Delta, Notch, and a 
 * Reporter of Notch Intracellular Domain in each cell. 
 * 
 * EMPTYLINE
 * 
 * The possibility of signalling through cellular protrusions is included, as based on models by
 * Baum et al. (2016) and Bajpai et al. (2020). The ODEs
 * for Notch and Delta include a reaction term that depends on the mean Delta and mean Notch
 * concentration among cells in junctional contact and in protrusional. 
 * Thus in this simulation each cell needs to be able to access information about its neighbours 
 * and its protrusional contacts. We use the {{{CellData}}} class to facilitate this, 
 * and introduce a new CellProperty for protruional contacts. 
 * A tracking modifier "DeltaNotchReporterProtrusionTrackingModifier" is introduced to update 
 * the relevant parameters at each time step.
 *
 * EMPTYLINE
 *
 * This test is used as a control for Notch-dependent cell division, as suggested by Hunter et al. (2016)
 * Ginger L. Hunter, Zena Hadjivasiliou, Hope Bonin, Li He, Norbert Perrimon, Guillaume Charras, Buzz Baum; 
 * "Coordinated control of Notch/Delta signalling and cell cycle progression drives lateral inhibition-mediated tissue patterning". 
 * Development 1 July 2016; 143 (13): 2305â€“2310. doi: https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.134213
 * For comparison of results obtained with Notch-dependent cell division, we assume that cells have a fixed
 * probability of division at each time step. This is achieved through Chaste's base {{{FixedProbabilityCellCycleModel}}}
 *
 * == The test ==
 *
 * EMPTYLINE
 *
 * As in previous tutorials, we begin by including the necessary header files. We have
 * encountered these files already. Recall that often, either {{{CheckpointArchiveTypes.hpp}}}
 * or {{{CellBasedSimulationArchiver.hpp}}} must be included the first Chaste header.
